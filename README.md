# SM Cheat Sheet Highlighter
Syntax highlighting to help proofread Sketch Master cheat sheets.


## Syntax themes
The SM Cheat Sheet Highlighter contains its own color palette, so the color that terms are highlighted in will not change with your chosen syntax theme for Atom. That theme will, however, determine other aspects of the Editor's appearance, like the background color, so certain themes work better with the SM CS Highlighter.

I recommend the following themes:
- One Dark `one-dark-syntax` (my fav)
- One Light `one-light-syntax`
- Atom Dark _preinstalled_
- Atom Light _preinstalled_


## Tips for Writing Grammar Matches
- The order of the match objects is important. The first to match is the only one that will match. In other words, if a word has multiple grammatical matches, it will only receive the classes from the highest-up grammatical match object.
